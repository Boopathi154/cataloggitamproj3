Overview:-
The Online Auction System is a console-based application that simulates the auction process. It allows users to create auctions, place bids, and manage auction outcomes efficiently. The system is designed to be user-friendly and ensures that all bids are conducted fairly, with notifications sent to bidders if they are outbid.

Features:-
1)Create Auction: Users can create auctions by specifying an item name, starting price, bid increment, and whether to notify previous bidders when they are outbid.
2)View Auctions: Displays all ongoing auctions with details such as the item name, starting price, highest bid, and current highest bidder.
3)Place Bid: Users can place bids on active auctions. The system ensures that bids meet the minimum bid increment and notifies the previous highest bidder if their bid is surpassed.
4)Close Auction: Allows users to close an auction, after which the highest bid and the winning bidder are announced.

How It Works:-
1)Create an Auction: Specify the auction item, set a starting price, determine the bid increment, and choose whether to notify outbid bidders.
2)Place a Bid: Enter your name and bid amount. The system will validate the bid and notify the previous highest bidder if necessary.
3)Close Auction: End the auction and announce the winner based on the highest bid.
